        Batman is a fictional character who first appeared in the 27th issue of Detective Comics in May 1939, and has become the world’s superhero with millions of fans around the world.his character has become one of the main characters of the 20th century, and a role model for millions of children and adults in the world. Such popularity and fame is associated with an unusual image of Batman, who used the image of a bat to perform heroic acts, aimed at fighting crime, injustice and evil.

        “Batman” is pseudonymous of a real man Bruce Wayne, who has an interesting life story. But I want to point some of his characteristics, which make him a real hero. According to Campbell (1988) “a hero performs a courageous act, either physical or spiritual”. So I would like to point and write about such important qualities of Batman, which make him real hero: physical and mental perfection.
        
        Batman spent his youth traveling the world, and improving himself mentally and physically. Through intensive training, specialized diets, and bio-additives, Batman represents the pinnacle of human development: his physical characteristics are close to the limits of Olympic athletes. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes and coordination are near perfection. Batman began his physical and emotional training at the age of 11 years, and at age 12 moved to the complicated physical training with heavy projectiles, and by 18 he was able to achieve complete control over the body. Bruce Wayne also tried to get different skills and methods to combat crime, including chemistry, criminology, martial arts, gymnastics, and secrecy, he mastered 127 martial techniques, including aikido, Yau-yan and ninjutsu. He had a strict regime (including aerobics, weight lifting, gymnastics, and simulated combat) to keep himself in peak condition, and often defeated opponents whose size, strength, or other features were much better than his own. He has spent his entire life in pursuit of physical perfection and achieved this through constant self-control and intensive training.For all the physical trauma that Batman has endured over the years, very few 
        injuries should come as a shock to fans of the Dark Knight. Yet, the story 
        Knightfall was quite distressing for the comic book audience who read along in 
        fascinated horror as the impossibly strong super-villain, Bane, snapped Batman’s 
        spine and incapacitated the hero for the remainder of the story.1 Realistically, an 
        injury of this nature was inevitable, as Batman constantly engages in violent 
        altercations and possesses no “super powers” to protect or heal him. However, 
        as a character based in fiction, Batman is not a man at all, but a symbol of 
        masculinity that defies physical weakness and represents male strength. As this 
        masculine symbol, Batman further substantiates the patriarchal belief in male 
        invincibility, and by extension, male dominance.
        In popular culture, lead male characters, like Batman, often exemplify 
        masculine traits that affirm their hero status. These traits correspond to 
        ascendant cultural ideologies, that is, strongly held beliefs typically learned 
        through cultural conditioning. Masculine ideology is the pervasive belief in the 
        superiority of men over women, which is present in and perpetuated by the 
        character of Batman. More specifically, Batman is made to look and act in a 
        manner that is consistent with masculine characteristics that are culturally 
        acceptable for the period in which the character is designed and disseminated.Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of DC's Superman; although Kane frequently claimed sole creation credit, Finger substantially developed the concept from a generic superhero into something more bat-like. The character received his own spin-off publication, Batman, in 1940. Batman was originally introduced as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals, but evolved into a character with a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting skills, and wealth. The 1960s Batman television series used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his darker roots in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating with the 1986 miniseries The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.

DC has featured Batman in many comic books, including comics published under its imprints such as Vertigo and Black Label. The longest-running Batman comic, Detective Comics, is the longest-running comic book in the United States. Batman is frequently depicted alongside other DC superheroes, such as Superman and Wonder Woman, as a member of organizations such as the Justice League and the Outsiders. In addition to Bruce Wayne, other characters have taken on the Batman persona on different occasions, such as Jean-Paul Valley / Azrael in the 1993–1994 "Knightfall" story arc; Dick Grayson, the first Robin, from 2009 to 2011; and Jace Fox, son of Wayne's ally Lucius, as of 2021.[4] DC has also published comics featuring alternate versions of Batman, including the incarnation seen in The Dark Knight Returns and its successors, the incarnation from the Flashpoint (2011) event, and numerous interpretations from Elseworlds stories.

One of the most iconic characters in popular culture, Batman has been listed among the greatest comic book superheroes and fictional characters ever created. He is one of the most commercially successful superheroes, and his likeness has been licensed and featured in various media and merchandise sold around the world; this includes toy lines such as Lego Batman and video games like the Batman: Arkham series. Batman has been adapted in live-action and animated incarnations, including the 1960s Batman television series played by Adam West and in film by Michael Keaton in Batman (1989), Batman Returns (1992), and The Flash (2023), Val Kilmer in Batman Forever (1995), George Clooney in Batman & Robin (1997), Christian Bale in The Dark Knight trilogy (2005–2012), Ben Affleck in the DC Extended Universe (2016–present), and Robert Pattinson in The Batman (2022). Kevin Conroy, Diedrich Bader, Jensen Ackles, Troy Baker, and Will Arnett, among others, have provided the character's voice.
